# _Banker
a little tool to make adulting easier.

underscoreBanker is a program I'm trying to get working that will parse an exported CSV from my bank account and sort the data
into a collection of lists.

From that collection, I plan on creating HTML reports that I can use to display average spending, overages, etc.

I have been working on a project called Wally that was made by my mentor that displays a series of webpages on a machine in his kitchen.
My plan eventually is to tie _Banker into Wally so I can have a kiosk in my office that displays the last months flow of money within my
household.

This is currently not working. Everything written here, with a few obvious exceptions, was written by me.
